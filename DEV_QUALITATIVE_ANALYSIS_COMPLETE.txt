SCORING METHODOLOGY
-------------------

Overall Score Calculation:
- Qualitative Assessment: 20% weight
- Quantitative Analysis: 25% weight  
- RASBITA Cost-Benefit: 25% weight
- RASBITA Governance: 15% weight
- Architecture Threat Modeling: 15% weight

Score Categories:
- 90-100%: Excellent
- 80-89%: Good  
- 70-79%: Satisfactory
- 60-69%: Needs Improvement
- <60%: Critical
