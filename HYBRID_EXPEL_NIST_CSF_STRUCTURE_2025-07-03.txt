HYBRID EXPEL + NIST CSF 2.0 STRUCTURE - JULY 3, 2025
=====================================================

Following PRP 3.0 protocols - HYBRID APPROACH IMPLEMENTATION

**APPROACH: Expel Format + Complete NIST CSF 2.0 Coverage**

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 1: GOVERN (GV) - 32 Controls**
âœ… KEEP EXPEL FORMAT (Perfect match with NIST)
- GV.OC: Organizational Context (5 controls)
- GV.RM: Risk Management Strategy (7 controls)
- GV.RR: Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (4 controls)
- GV.PO: Policy (2 controls)
- GV.OV: Oversight (3 controls)
- GV.SC: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (10 controls)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 2: IDENTIFY (ID) - 21 Controls**
âœ… KEEP EXPEL FORMAT (Perfect match with NIST)
- ID.AM: Asset Management (7 controls)
- ID.RA: Risk Assessment (10 controls)
- ID.IM: Improvement (4 controls)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 3: PROTECT (PR) - HYBRID APPROACH**
ðŸ”„ ENHANCED EXPEL FORMAT + NIST ADDITIONS

**Current Expel Categories (Keep):**
- PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (6 controls)
- PR.AT: Awareness and Training (2 controls)
- PR.DS: Data Security (4 controls: 01, 02, 10, 11)
- PR.PS: Platform Security (6 controls)
- PR.IR: Technology Infrastructure Resilience (4 controls)

**NIST Additions to Complete Coverage:**
- PR.MA: Maintenance (3 controls) - NEW
- PR.PT: Protective Technology (5 controls) - NEW
- PR.DS: Data Security EXPANDED (add missing 7 controls: 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09)

**Result: 8 categories, ~30 controls total**

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 4: DETECT (DE) - HYBRID APPROACH**
ðŸ”„ ENHANCED EXPEL FORMAT + NIST ADDITIONS

**Current Expel Categories (Keep):**
- DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring (8 controls)
- DE.AE: Adverse Event Analysis (rename to "Anomalies and Events") (5 controls)

**NIST Addition:**
- DE.DP: Detection Processes (3 controls) - NEW

**Result: 3 categories, ~16 controls total**

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 5: RESPOND (RS) - HYBRID APPROACH**
ðŸ”„ ENHANCED EXPEL FORMAT + NIST ALIGNMENT

**Current Expel Categories (Rename for NIST compliance):**
- RS.MA: Management (was "Incident Management") (2 controls)
- RS.AN: Analysis (was "Incident Analysis") (5 controls)
- RS.MI: Mitigation (was "Incident Mitigation") (3 controls)
- RS.RP: Reporting (was "RS.CO: Incident Response Reporting") (3 controls)

**Result: 4 categories, ~13 controls total**

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 6: RECOVER (RC) - HYBRID APPROACH**
ðŸ”„ ENHANCED EXPEL FORMAT + NIST ADDITIONS

**Current Expel Categories (Keep):**
- RC.RP: Recovery Planning (was "Incident Recovery Plan Execution") (5 controls)
- RC.CO: Communications (was "Incident Recovery Communication") (3 controls)

**NIST Addition:**
- RC.IM: Improvements (2 controls) - NEW

**Result: 3 categories, ~10 controls total**

**HYBRID STRUCTURE SUMMARY:**
===============================

**Total Framework:**
- GOVERN: 32 controls (unchanged)
- IDENTIFY: 21 controls (unchanged)
- PROTECT: ~30 controls (enhanced from 23)
- DETECT: ~16 controls (enhanced from 13)
- RESPOND: ~13 controls (renamed for compliance)
- RECOVER: ~10 controls (enhanced from 8)

**TOTAL: ~122 controls (vs your current ~108)**

**BENEFITS OF HYBRID APPROACH:**
1. âœ… Preserves your working Expel format
2. âœ… Achieves complete NIST CSF 2.0 coverage
3. âœ… Maintains current questionnaire compatibility
4. âœ… Adds missing controls for comprehensive assessment
5. âœ… Perfect for RASBITA Governance implementation

**IMPLEMENTATION IMPACT:**
- Your current assessments remain valid
- Enhanced coverage for future assessments
- RASBITA Governance ready with authentic GOVERN structure
- Improved compliance with official NIST standards

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Review this hybrid structure
2. Approve implementation plan
3. Begin RASBITA Governance development
4. Gradually enhance other functional areas

**QUESTION FOR APPROVAL:**
Does this hybrid approach (Expel foundation + NIST completeness) meet your requirements?
