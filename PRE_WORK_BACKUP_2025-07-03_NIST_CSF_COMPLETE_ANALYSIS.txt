==================================================================

TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-03 Session Start
PRP 3.0 PROTOCOL: MANDATORY BACKUP BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

USER PROVIDED COMPLETE NIST CSF 2.0 STRUCTURE:
=============================================

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 1: GOVERN (32 controls)**

- Risk Management Strategy (GV.RM): 7 controls (GV.RM-01 through GV.RM-07)
- Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (GV.RR): 4 controls (GV.RR-01 through GV.RR-04)
- Policy (GV.PO): 2 controls (GV.PO-01, GV.PO-02)
- Oversight (GV.OV): 3 controls (GV.OV-01 through GV.OV-03)
- Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (GV.SC): 10 controls (GV.SC-01 through GV.SC-10)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 2: IDENTIFY (13 controls)**
Categories:
- Asset Management (ID.AM): 7 controls (ID.AM-01, ID.AM-02, ID.AM-03, ID.AM-04, ID.AM-05, ID.AM-07, ID.AM-08)
- Risk Assessment (ID.RA): 10 controls (ID.RA-01 through ID.RA-10)
- Improvement (ID.IM): 4 controls (ID.IM-01 through ID.IM-04)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 3: PROTECT (23 controls)**
Categories:
- Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA): 6 controls (PR.AA-01 through PR.AA-06)
- Awareness and Training (PR.AT): 2 controls (PR.AT-01, PR.AT-02)
- Data Security (PR.DS): 11 controls (PR.DS-01 through PR.DS-11)
- Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP): 4 controls (PR.IP-01 through PR.IP-06)
- Maintenance (PR.MA): 2 controls (PR.MA-01, PR.MA-02)
- Protective Technology (PR.PT): 4 controls (PR.PT-01 through PR.PT-05)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 4: DETECT (13 controls)**
Categories:
- Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): 9 controls (DE.CM-01 through DE.CM-09)
- Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE): 8 controls (DE.AE-02 through DE.AE-08, plus DE.AE-01)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 5: RESPOND (15 controls)**
Categories:
- Incident Management (RS.MA): 5 controls (RS.MA-01 through RS.MA-05)
- Incident Analysis (RS.AN): 4 controls (RS.AN-03, RS.AN-05, RS.AN-07, RS.AN-08)
- Incident Response Reporting and Communication (RS.CO): 3 controls (RS.CO-02, RS.CO-03, RS.CO-05)
- Incident Mitigation (RS.MI): 3 controls (RS.MI-01, RS.MI-02, RS.MI-03)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 6: RECOVER (11 controls)**
Categories:
- Incident Recovery Plan Execution (RC.RP): 6 controls (RC.RP-01 through RC.RP-06)
- Incident Recovery Communication (RC.CO): 4 controls (RC.CO-03, RC.CO-04, plus 2 others)

**TOTAL STRUCTURE:**
- 6 Functional Areas
- 106+ Individual Controls/Subcategories
- 5-Tier Scoring System (0-4): 0% / 25% / 50% / 75% / 100%

**UPDATED CONTROL COUNTS FROM USER'S COMPLETE STRUCTURE:**

**FUNCTIONAL AREA CONTROL COUNTS:**
- GOVERN: 32 controls ✓ (confirmed from images)
- IDENTIFY: 13 controls ✓ (confirmed: 7 Asset Mgmt + 10 Risk Assessment + 4 Improvement = 21 total, need recount)
- PROTECT: 23 controls (confirmed from images: 6+2+11+4+2+4 categories)
- DETECT: 13 controls (confirmed from images: 9 Continuous Monitoring + 8 Adverse Event Analysis = 17 total, need recount)
- RESPOND: 15 controls (confirmed from images: 5+4+3+3 categories)
- RECOVER: 11 controls (confirmed from images: 6+4+others categories)

**CORRECTED ANALYSIS NEEDED:**
Our initial extraction missed significant controls in PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER functional areas.
Total should be approximately 107+ controls across all 6 functional areas.

**RASBITA GOVERNANCE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:**
- Use GOVERN functional area (32 controls) for RASBITA Governance (15% pillar)
- Apply 5-tier scoring system properly
- Map questionnaire responses to GOVERN controls
- Fix current system treating RASBITA Governance as 1 of 11 equal parameters

**CURRENT SYSTEM ISSUES:**
1. RASBITA Governance incorrectly weighted as ~9.09% (1/11 parameters)
2. Missing proper NIST CSF 2.0 control structure
3. No tier-to-percentage conversion logic
4. Incorrect 5-pillar framework integration

**NEXT STEPS AWAITING USER APPROVAL:**
1. Create comprehensive NIST CSF 2.0 control library
2. Implement GOVERN functional area for RASBITA Governance
3. Fix 5-pillar scoring to proper 15% weighting
4. Update questionnaire mapping to GOVERN controls
5. Implement tier-to-percentage conversion logic
