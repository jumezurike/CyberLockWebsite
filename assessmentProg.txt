ASSESSMENT PROGRESS UNDERSTANDING - 2025-06-11

RASBITA FRAMEWORK CLARIFICATION:
- RASBITA-CBF (Cost-Benefit Financial): Cost-benefit analysis with financial values, incident financial impact assessment, ROI calculations
- RASBITA-RGM (Risk Governance & Management): Risk governance maturity assessment, management framework evaluation
- Display Rule: Use RASBITA-CBF and RASBITA-RGM ONLY in assessment progress line/phase display, leave all other RASBITA references unchanged

9-PHASE ASSESSMENT PROGRESSION:

PURPLE (Completed in Preliminary Stage):
1. Inquiry & Questionnaire - Form submission completed
2. Interview & Matrix Population - Basic stakeholder input gathered  
3. Matrix Population - Initial infrastructure data collected
4. RASBITA-RGM - Governance maturity assessment through questionnaire (reduces risk, impact, saves money)
5. Gap Analysis - Critical phase identifying missing controls from sections 2-13 (what org should have vs what they actually have - gaps create serious vulnerabilities)
6. Preliminary Report - Qualitative expert opinion analysis

GREEN (Requires Comprehensive Assessment):
7. Architecture Threat Modeling - Requires deep STRIDE analysis with actual system architecture
8. RASBITA-CBF - Detailed financial analysis with quantitative ROI calculations and incident data
9. Comprehensive Report - Final quantitative analysis with 6+ months monitoring data

KEY POINTS:
- Breaches can happen during preliminary stage - both RASBITA components available for incident response
- Gap Analysis identifies missing security controls and compliance failures that create high risk
- Organizations with mature cybersecurity risk governance & management have reduced risk, less impact, and save money
- Preliminary: Immediate expert analysis, basic financial impact if incidents occur
- Comprehensive: Deep quantitative analysis with extensive monitoring infrastructure and data collection

CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX:
1. Phase color coding - preliminary shows all purple incorrectly
2. "Comprehensive Report Phase" showing during preliminary assessment
3. Button functionality in sections #12, #13, #14, #15 (recently fixed)
4. Report generation logic distinguishing preliminary vs comprehensive
