Healthcare organizational and system security analysis (HOS^2A)
               (Complete this questionnaire to begin your assessment)
1. Business Information

2. Infrastructure Mode of Operation

What we try to do here is to figure out the:
-Operating system. (identify OS)
-Potential Security Risks (identify potential risk)
-Potential Vulnerabilities (identify potential risk)

These must be known from the business point of view with respecting the infrastructure mode of operation. These information are usually supplied by the business during questionnaire: It could also be validated during matrix population. 

3. Configuration Baseline

- OS / System Hardening
- CIS Benchmark

4. Security Control Framework
-Operations
-Management
-Technology
-People

There are limitations to what framework applies to operations or management or technology or people or more controls... Find the table below for that.

5. Compliance

6. Regulatory requirements

7. Standards

8. Relevant Questionnaires
What we want to do is to check what questionnaire and checklist that will be needed for the application of
-Security Control Framework
-Compliance
-Regulatory Requirements
-Standards
e.g if you choose PCI-DSS we must find the security assessment question that is relevant to that. I have compiled an exhaustive table below:

Framework	Questionnaire Type	Purpose	Applicability	Key Focus Areas	Resource Link
PCI-DSS	SAQ A, A-EP, B, B-IP, C, C-VT, D, P2PE-HW	Payment security	Merchants/service providers handling card data	Encryption, access control, network security	PCI SSC SAQs
HIPAA	HIPAA Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool	Protected Health Information (PHI) security	Healthcare providers, insurers, business associates	Data encryption, audit logs, breach notification	HHS SRA Tool
SOC 2	SOC 2 Readiness Questionnaire	Trust services criteria (security, availability, confidentiality)	Cloud service providers, SaaS companies	Access controls, incident response, data integrity	AICPA SOC 2
ISO 27001	ISO 27001 Self-Assessment Questionnaire	Information Security Management System (ISMS)	Organizations of all sizes	Risk management, asset protection, continuous improvement	ISO 27001 Checklist
NIST CSF	NIST Cybersecurity Framework Self-Assessment	Cyber risk management	Critical infrastructure, federal agencies	Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover	NIST CSF Tool

9. Adversarial Insight (Mitre ATT&CK)
-Tactic
-Technique

The ideas is when going over the matrix adversarial insight. We must identify the ATT&CK for a particular potential vulnerability and the security risk. If a Tactics is chosen the corresponding techniques will appear. Then we have to choose the appropriate one which is most likely. For example Credential access tactic TA0006, password guessing T1110.001 or brute force T1110 ETC, are techniques that could apply here. Then when we do the monitoring during comprehensive report we will see for sure in the SIEM. 

10. ISMS
-Policies
-Procedures
-Plans
-Process

After the matrix is first populated based on the information the business supplies. We would provide the relevant tools (policies, procedures, plans, process) they need to run their business. We can now determine what they need focusing on the industry as a part of the GAP analysis. This will be provided to the business.
