Healthcare-Specific Examples
Guideline	Focus Area	Key Recommendations
NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2	HIPAA compliance	Risk analysis templates, encryption case studies
FDA Post-market Medical Device Cybersecurity	Vulnerability management	Patch EOL devices, network segmentation
HHS Telehealth Security Guidelines	Remote care	Endpoint protection, secure video platforms
Key Differences: Standards vs. Guidelines
Aspect	Standards	Guidelines
Enforcement	Mandatory (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS)	Voluntary best practices
Flexibility	Prescriptive controls	Adaptable recommendations
Examples	ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53	NIST SP 800-66, CIS Benchmarks
