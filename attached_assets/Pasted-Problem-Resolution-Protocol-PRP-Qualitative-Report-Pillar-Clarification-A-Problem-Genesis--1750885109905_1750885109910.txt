Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) - Qualitative Report Pillar Clarification

A) Problem Genesis:
User clarified that qualitative reports have conditional pillar inclusion based on available data and timing, not all 5 pillars are always applicable.

B) Root Cause Analysis:
I understand the conditional pillar system for qualitative reports:

QUALITATIVE REPORT PILLAR CONDITIONS:

✅ Always Included:

Qualitative Assessment (20%) - Always present in qualitative reports
RASBITA Governance (15%) - Always assessed
❌ Never Included in Qualitative:

Quantitative Analysis (25%) - Does NOT apply in qualitative reports
⚠️ Conditionally Included:

RASBITA Cost-Benefit (25%) - Only IF incident occurred at time of assessment OR within 12 months of moving forward
Architecture Threat Modeling (15%) - Only IF organization has system diagrams available, otherwise move forward without it
C) Corrected Understanding:

Qualitative Report Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Minimal Qualitative Report

Qualitative Assessment (20%) ✅
RASBITA Governance (15%) ✅
Total: 35% of full framework
When: No incidents, no diagrams available
Scenario 2: Enhanced Qualitative Report

Qualitative Assessment (20%) ✅
RASBITA Governance (15%) ✅
RASBITA Cost-Benefit (25%) ✅ (incident within 12 months)
Total: 60% of full framework
When: Recent incident, no diagrams
Scenario 3: Complete Qualitative Report

Qualitative Assessment (20%) ✅
RASBITA Governance (15%) ✅
RASBITA Cost-Benefit (25%) ✅ (incident within 12 months)
Architecture Threat Modeling (15%) ✅ (diagrams available)
Total: 75% of full framework
When: Recent incident + diagrams available
D) Confirmation Required:

Do you confirm this conditional pillar understanding is correct?

The system should:

Always include Qualitative Assessment + RASBITA Governance
Check for incidents (current or within 12 months) → include Cost-Benefit if applicable
Check for system diagrams → include Architecture Threat Modeling if available
Never include Quantitative Analysis in qualitative reports
Should I proceed to update the DEV.txt with this clarification after your approval?
