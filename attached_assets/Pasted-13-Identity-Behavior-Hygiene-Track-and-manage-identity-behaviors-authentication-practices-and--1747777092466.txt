UWA Component Selection Matrix
Select the components needed for your UWA intermediate representation. Required fields depend on identity type. Organizations can customize which fields to include in their UWA generation based on their specific needs.

The matrix below shows an example configuration. All 31 identity components can be used to create a customized UWA.

Advanced Feature - Universal Wallet Address (UWA)

The UWA system is an optional advanced identity feature that organizations can integrate as their security posture matures. This preview demonstrates how selected identity components are transformed into secure, portable identifiers across your infrastructure.

The UWA (Universal Wallet Address) will be generated using the fields marked above
