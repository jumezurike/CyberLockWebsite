I want to build a new website for cyberlockx.xyz. The value proposition we have for our product is "We provide small and medium-sized businesses with an integrated safe browser that ensures data security and privacy while simplifying their cybersecurity needs. Our catch phrase is, securing every click!!! 

Product name: Secure Business Application Hub
The site will showcase an MVP of secure web application built on a safe web browser. Here are the core features of the browser:

SMB organizational and system security analysis.-SOS2A 
AI agent built to secure browsers, SOS2A automates real-time audit, compliance proof (ISO/SOC) and threat prevention—turning all activity into auditable evidence.


Secure Meet
Encrypted communications platform for secure video conferences, messaging, and collaboration.


Secure Payment
Advanced transaction encryption to protect your financial data and customer information. (patented)


Secure Business Cloud
Robust data protection and collaboration tools, with seamless integration for managed service providers. (patented)


Secure True Digital ID
Next-generation identity verification and industry-specific encryption for unparalleled security. (patented)


Secure Cloud (Google)
Safeguards data with advanced encryption and data access controls. (patented)


Secure ML/AI Language Augmentation
Threat-anomaly detection, text, form data, cookies, cache encryption and language enhancement. 

SMB organization and system security analysis (SOS2A) tool or web application should be implemented to provides a comprehensive approach of taking data from a spreadsheet and turn it into a report. Take a look at this link https://each1teach1.us/SOS2APortal. SMB organization and system security analysis.- SOS2A is vital for small businesses especially with the advent of AI. We believe that frontier security will benefit from centralization of web applications on a safe browser.

Implement the application following this process:
Step 1. The hosting organization(SOC Analyst) sends out a questionnaire to the SMB who needs the help: They will fill it out. 
Step 2. The interview follows with the population of the matrix coming afterwards. This is done with the ongoing help of the responses from the questionnaire, check SMB as they are interviewed or after interview. 
Step 3. The deliverable from (step 2): Stakeholder preliminary report followed by In-time analysis;
SIEM, IDS, IPS engage for monitoring and corroborating (qualitative and quantitative) analysis.
-Rubric to score the assessment out of 100%
-Diagram to show business impact using RASBITA (on works). Stakeholder cyber security risk and compliance comprehensive report is completed as the final deliverable. 

Sep 4. Deliverable from step 3:
Stakeholder comprehensive report
Identified cybersecurity risks/threats (industry and specific)
Identified vulnerabilities
Fathering mitigation strategies
Fathering Compliances/Reg/Standards
SOC practice (continuous monitoring)
Engage SIEM, IDS, IPS for monitoring and corroborating (qualitative and quantitative results)
-Rubric to score the assessment out of 100%
-Diagram to show business impact using RASBITA (finale)
Cyber risk management leads to the finale of applying the controls in the mitigation strategy. 

To assist you and make things clear. I will upload 
1. A SOS2A template for you. In the first worksheet you will see the fields needed. 
              2. Sample preliminary report
              3. We will provide the comprehensive report after bringing their endpoints into our SOC environment for 6 months for some observable cybersecurity maturity model certification. *Note #3 should be provided later.
              4. RASBITA is still on the works: Risk Assessment score by impact and threat analysis. It will attach financial value to threats if there was any in the environment.  

Note=> The preliminaries are done in weeks. However to get the comprehensive report we need at least 6 months of monitoring to 1. Get the system security posture and trends 2. To make sure that the quantitative analysis is contrasted with the qualitative non-cost based speculation of the interview process. 3. To make sure the risk management level is improved given the NIST CSF framework 2.0 and CIS CSC v8.1. This will require adding customers endpoints into our SOC environment for monitoring and responding to the incidents within SMBs environment or infrastructure. The comprehensive analysis should be completed between 6month to a year or whatever it takes the SMB to reach mature security. 

There should be a follow up with mitigation strategies: 1. Access Control Policies: Implement strict access control measures and
enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical systems to ensure
only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems.

Regular Software Updates & Patches: Continuously update all software
and systems, patching vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by
cybercriminals. Ensure both in-house and third-party systems are
up-to-date.
Employee Training: Invest in regular training to help employees recognize
phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and how to report suspicious
activities. Awareness is a key component in preventing these types of
attacks.
Incident Response Plan (IRP): Develop and implement an incident
response strategy that outlines clear procedures for detecting, containing,
Cybersecurity Risk and Compliance Assessment
and mitigating cybersecurity threats in real-time. This will help minimize
damage and downtime in the event of an attack.
SOC Monitoring: Establish continuous monitoring via a Security
Operations Center (SOC), utilizing automated tools and threat detection
systems (SIEM, IDS/IPS) to identify unusual activity early and respond
swiftly to potential threats.

SOS2A agents are continuously profiling the hits on the browser making sure there is policy driven auto keyword encryption, industry sensitive word encryption, form field encryption, cache encryption, and secure authentication using ECSMID + DatashieldAI making sure that all entities requiring authentication no longer have to move, reuse, store, and maintain keys. Please give me the website and the web application the color should be the same as https://each1teach1.us/SOS2APortal Dark purple light green and whitish grey. Sleek and modern looking...

Why Competitors Can’t Compete
AFA Browser
• U.S. Patent 10,911,217 (ECSMID) + DataShieldAI = Quantum-proof OWASP immunity
• Encrypts all data (cache/RAM/transit)
Others rely on vulnerable TLS or bolt-on VPNs
SOS2A AI Agent
• Live compliance engine: Auto-generates ISO/SOC/GDPR reports
• Self-healing mitigations (e.g., auto-patching)
Guardz/CrowdStrike: Manual evidence collection
Hybrid SOC
• AI + human analysts 24/7
• Custom OWASP/SANS rules for SMB workflows
Pure AI tools (Cynet) miss business-context threats
Integrated Apps
• One quantum-safe surface for:
- Google Docs/Sheets (cell-level encryption)
- Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Secure Meet (E2E-encrypted)
- Payments (PCI DSS-ready)
