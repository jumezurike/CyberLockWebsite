Mapping Deep Scan Parameters to Qualitative Analysis Proof
Deep Scan Parameter (Quantitative)	Proof of Qualitative Assessment Area	How Deep Scanning Provides Proof & Validation
1. Vulnerability & Patch Mgmt	- Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Baseline Configuration	Provides quantitative CVE & vulnerability counts, patch levels, asset exposure, directly validating risks, vulnerabilities, and configuration baselines.
2. Misconfigurations	- Baseline Configuration
- Standards & Guidelines
- Regulatory Requirements	Quantitative proof via configuration audits, compliance percentages against CIS or NIST baselines, demonstrating adherence to standards & regulatory requirements.
3. Malware & Endpoint Security	- Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Relevant ACQ Tools
- Device Inventory Tracking	Endpoint security logs validate malware presence, device integrity, EDR effectiveness. Confirms inventory accuracy through endpoint detection.
4. Credential Exposure & IAM	- Identity Behavior & Hygiene
- Compliance Requirements
- Standards & Guidelines	IAM audit logs quantitatively validate adherence to credential management standards, demonstrate identity hygiene, compliance with regulatory identity requirements.
5. Phishing & Email Security	- Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Security Control vs Framework
- Regulatory Requirements	Phishing detection statistics quantify security control effectiveness, validate compliance with regulatory email security mandates.
6. Cloud Security Posture	- Baseline Configuration
- Standards & Guidelines
- Compliance & Regulatory Requirements	Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools quantitatively validate adherence to cloud baselines, regulatory compliance, and alignment with industry standards.
7. Network Exposure & Zero Trust	- Security Control vs Framework
- Adversarial Insight (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Baseline Configuration	Quantitative proof via network exposure scans, segmentation compliance, validating Zero Trust architecture effectiveness and mapping to adversarial attack vectors (MITRE ATT&CK).
8. Data Security & Leakage	- Compliance Requirements
- Regulatory Requirements
- Information Security Management System (ISMS)	Data leakage scans & DLP logs provide quantifiable proof of adherence to data security policies, validating regulatory and compliance requirements within ISMS frameworks.
9. Browser & Web Security	- Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Standards & Guidelines
- Relevant ACQ Tools	Web vulnerability reports quantitatively prove adherence to secure browser standards, validate relevant toolsâ€™ effectiveness, and identify web-based risks.
10. Compliance & Frameworks	- Compliance Requirements
- Regulatory Requirements
- Standards & Guidelines	Automated GRC platform dashboards provide numerical evidence of adherence to compliance, regulatory frameworks (ISO, SOC2, HIPAA), and validate documented standards.
11. Threat Intelligence	- Adversarial Insight (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Relevant ACQ Tools	Threat intelligence reports quantitatively validate adversarial threats, effectiveness of threat mitigation tools, and alignment to known adversarial patterns via MITRE ATT&CK.
12. Security Awareness & Insider Risk	- Identity Behavior & Hygiene
- Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Compliance Requirements	Insider risk analytics quantitatively verify effectiveness of security awareness programs, adherence to ISMS controls, validate behavior monitoring and insider threat policies.
