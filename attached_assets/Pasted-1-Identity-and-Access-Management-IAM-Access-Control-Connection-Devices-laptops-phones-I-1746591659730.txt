1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) & Access Control
Connection:

Devices (laptops, phones, IoT, servers) have identities (certificates, MAC/IP, device IDs).

IAM systems use device inventory to enforce policies (e.g., only corporate-managed devices can access sensitive data).

Access Control relies on device trustworthiness (e.g., is the device compliant with security policies?).

Impact:

Poor device tracking = Unauthorized devices gaining access.

Strong inventory hygiene = Better enforcement of least privilege.

2. Network Security
Connection:

Network segmentation & NAC (Network Access Control) depend on knowing which devices are allowed on the network.

Unknown/unmanaged devices can be automatically quarantined.

Impact:

Without device inventory, rogue devices (e.g., malware-infected laptops) can move laterally.

3. Asset Management
Connection:

Device inventory is a subset of IT asset management (hardware, software, cloud instances).

Tracks device lifecycle (procurement, deployment, retirement).

Impact:

Missing devices = Unpatched vulnerabilities, compliance failures.

4. Compliance Management
Connection:

Regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) require tracking devices that handle sensitive data.

Audits demand proof of device controls (e.g., encryption, patch levels).

Impact:

No device inventory = Compliance violations, fines.

5. Incident Response
Connection:

During a breach, responders need to know:

Which devices were compromised?

What data did they access?

Forensic investigations rely on device logs and inventory records.

Impact:

Poor tracking slows down containment and recovery.

6. Data Protection
Connection:

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools block unauthorized devices from accessing sensitive files.

Encryption policies depend on knowing which devices store regulated data.

Impact:

Unaccounted devices = Data leaks (e.g., stolen laptops with customer info).

7. Third-Party Management
Connection:

Vendor/contractor devices must be tracked and restricted.

BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies rely on inventory controls.

Impact:

Unmanaged third-party devices = Supply chain attacks.

8. Application Security
Connection:

Applications should only allow access from trusted devices.

Device attestation (e.g., TPM checks) prevents unauthorized app access.

Impact:

Weak device controls = Credential theft, API abuse.

9. Security Governance
Connection:

Policies must define how devices are classified, monitored, and retired.

Risk assessments depend on knowing device exposure.

Impact:

Lack of governance = Shadow IT, uncontrolled device sprawl.

10. Security Awareness
Connection:

Employees must understand:

Why device registration matters.

Risks of using unauthorized devices.

Impact:

Poor awareness = Employees bypassing security controls (e.g., using personal USB drives).
