2. Mode of Operation & Security Risks
Primary Areas of Operation
Website & Social Media Presence: Customer engagement and marketing.
POS Systems & Cellular Data Networks: Transaction processing.
Email Communication (Without Website): Internal and external communications.
Internet Access through ISP/Mobile Data/Hotspots: Connectivity for operations.
Identified Security Risks
Phishing & Spoofing: Cybercriminals exploiting weak email and social media security.
Data Privacy Breaches: Vulnerabilities in POS systems and social media controls.
Malware & Hacking: Threats to unpatched systems and insecure applications.
Account Hijacking: Unauthorized access to social platforms, impacting reputation.
Potential Vulnerabilities
Weak authentication mechanisms and lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Outdated or unpatched software exposing critical systems.
Misconfigured cloud and network services leading to data leaks.
Insecure APIs and file uploads increase attack surface.

3. Cybersecurity Risk Management
Risk Identification
SOS2A identifies the following primary risks:
Data Exfiltration: Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Business Disruption: Operational downtime from ransomware or DDoS attacks.
Reputational Damage: Misinformation or breaches affecting public trust.
Risk Assessment
Likelihood:
High: Phishing attacks, unpatched vulnerabilities.
Medium: Ransomware and DDoS attacks.
Impact:
High: Compliance violations and customer data breaches.
Medium: Temporary operational disruptions.
Risk Mitigation Strategies
Technical Controls:
Deploy SIEM and IDS/IPS tools for continuous monitoring.
Implement endpoint protection and encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Procedural Controls:
Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP) with defined roles and processes.
Enforce MFA and strict role-based access controls.
Conduct regular employee training on phishing awareness and secure data handling.

4. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
Applicable Standards
PCI-DSS: Protection of cardholder data in payment systems.
HIPAA: Safeguarding healthcare-related data.
CMMC: Meeting cybersecurity maturity requirements for defense contractors.
GDPR & CCPA: Enforcing data privacy for global and California-specific regulations.
SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001: Continuous monitoring and data protection standards.
Compliance Gaps
Limited implementation of data encryption protocols.
Lack of routine security audits and employee awareness programs.
Missing documentation and procedures for incident response.

5. SOC Framework: Monitoring, Detection, and Incident Response
Key Components of the SOC Framework
Continuous Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of systems and network traffic using SIEM tools.
Threat Detection: Leveraging automated tools to identify and flag suspicious activities early.
Incident Response Plan (IRP): A well-defined IRP to respond swiftly to detected incidents, minimizing downtime and impact.

6. Security Threats & Mitigation Strategies
Threats Identified
Phishing & Social Engineering: Exploiting employee vulnerabilities.
DDoS Attacks: Overloading network services, disrupting operations.
Reputational Damage: Compromised social media accounts spreading misinformation.
{Scorecard should be here}
Five visual details of the pillar and the over scoring.

Mitigation Strategies
Access Control Policies: Enforce MFA and role-based access control across all platforms.
Regular Updates & Patches: Ensure all software is current and free of known vulnerabilities.
Employee Training: Ongoing cybersecurity education for recognizing and avoiding threats.
SOC Integration: Establish continuous monitoring and automated detection mechanisms.

7. Recommendations
Strengthen web security with encryption, secure coding, and regular vulnerability scans.
Enhance data privacy controls to meet GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS standards.
Build a robust SOC framework with continuous monitoring and real-time threat detection.
Train employees on cybersecurity best practices, focusing on phishing awareness and secure data handling.
Implement MFA across critical systems to reduce unauthorized access.
