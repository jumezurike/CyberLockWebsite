Data Nuclear Aggregate (DNA)
DNA PROTECTED
The comprehensive aggregation of identity data forming a complete digital profile

Universal Digital Identity
The DNA forms an immutable, verifiable identity core that combines government-verified credentials with behavioral intelligence.

Government Identity Verification
Government ID Type
Critical
Driver's license, state ID, passport, or other official identification

Issuing Authority
Critical
Government entity that issued the identification document

ID Verification Status
Whether the ID has been validated and confirmed

Core Identity
Full Name
Critical
Legal name as appears on official documents

Identity Type
Human, machine, service account, or API classification

Unique Identifier
Critical
Universal ID that persists across all systems

Organizational Context
Department/Team
Organizational unit or functional group

Role/Position
Job function or service purpose

Reporting Hierarchy
Management chain and responsibility structure

Access & Entitlements
Access Level
Privilege tier and permission scope

System Entitlements
Specific rights and access grants across systems

Authentication Methods
MFA status and credential mechanisms

Behavioral Patterns
Access Patterns
Typical login hours and behavioral baselines

Location Data
Normal physical or network access points

Security Posture
Compliance with security policies and training

Risk Indicators
Risk Classification
Assessment of identity risk level

Anomaly Detection
Tracking of unusual behaviors or access patterns

Credential Exposure
Records of potential credential compromise events

Lifecycle Management
Creation & Onboarding
Initial provisioning and account creation

Credential Rotation
Password changes and certificate renewals

Deprovisioning Process
Account deactivation and offboarding workflows

Visual Identity Verification
Color-Coded Profile Image
Critical
Non-fungible cryptographically signed profile picture with embedded steganographic data

Image Modification History
Immutable record of all changes to visual identity elements

Visual Hash Verification
Cryptographic validation of image integrity and authenticity

Continuous Identity Verification
The DNA continuously verifies all aspects of identity through a multi-layered approach. Government-issued ID creates the strong foundation that anchors the digital identity to a real-world, verifiable entity, enabling powerful accountability throughout the system.

Color-Coded Non-Fungible Image Verification
Advanced Security Feature:All identity profiles must include a color-coded non-fungible profile image that contains hidden encrypted data using steganography. This creates a cryptographically unique visual identifier that cannot be duplicated or transferred between identities. The embedded data can only be detected and verified through a specialized decryption process.

All image changes are permanently recorded in an immutable ledger, creating a complete audit trail of visual identity modifications.
