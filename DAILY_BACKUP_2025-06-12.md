# DAILY BACKUP - June 12, 2025

## Current System Status
- **Application Status:** Running successfully
- **Core Functionality:** Operational
- **Critical Issue:** Section 12 (Device Inventory) missing complete 7-section structure
- **User Requirement:** Complete device inventory table with filtering, Add Device button, CSV import/export

## Working Files (As of 2025-06-12)
- `client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form-current.tsx` - Main questionnaire file
- `client/src/components/device-inventory/clean-device-inventory.tsx` - Complete device inventory component (from JUdevpro0682025.txt backup)
- `JUdevpro0682025.txt` - Master backup file with correct implementation

## Section 12 Requirements (User Confirmed)
1. Complete device inventory table with 27+ columns
2. Filter Tool with blue highlighting and dropdown
3. Add Device button (purple, top-right)
4. Import CSV and Download Template buttons
5. 7 subsections:
   - 1. Identification
   - 2. Classification  
   - 3. Network & Location
   - 4. Security & Compliance
   - 5. Lifecycle Management
   - 6. Usage & Monitoring
   - 7. Risk Assessment

## Critical Files to Preserve
- `client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form-current.tsx`
- `client/src/components/device-inventory/clean-device-inventory.tsx`
- `shared/schema.ts`
- `JUdevpro0682025.txt`

## User Feedback
- User stressed importance of daily backups to prevent repeated data loss
- Previous restoration attempts using old backups failed
- User has correct implementation in 100mb GitHub repo but cannot share
- Must follow backup strategy and get explicit permission before major changes

## Next Actions Required
1. Create daily backup before any changes
2. Get user permission before implementing changes
3. Use JUdevpro0682025.txt backup as reference for correct implementation
4. Restore complete 7-section device inventory structure

## Implementation Notes
- User confirmed the device inventory component exists in `client/src/components/device-inventory/clean-device-inventory.tsx`
- This component shows the exact structure needed for section 12
- Must integrate this component into the questionnaire properly
