ACCURATE NIST CSF 2.0 CONTROL COUNT ANALYSIS - JULY 3, 2025
=============================================================

Based on user-provided images of complete NIST CSF 2.0 structure:

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 1: GOVERN (32 controls)**
✓ CONFIRMED: 32 controls across 6 categories
- Organizational Context (GV.OC): 5 controls
- Risk Management Strategy (GV.RM): 7 controls  
- Roles, Responsibilities, Authorities (GV.RR): 4 controls
- Policy (GV.PO): 2 controls
- Oversight (GV.OV): 3 controls
- Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Mgmt (GV.SC): 10 controls
Total: 5+7+4+2+3+10 = 31 controls (need verification for 32nd)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 2: IDENTIFY (21 controls)**
From image analysis:
- Asset Management (ID.AM): 7 controls (ID.AM-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, 08)
- Risk Assessment (ID.RA): 10 controls (ID.RA-01 through ID.RA-10)
- Improvement (ID.IM): 4 controls (ID.IM-01 through ID.IM-04)
Total: 7+10+4 = 21 controls

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 3: PROTECT (25+ controls)**
From image analysis:
- Identity Mgmt, Authentication, Access Control (PR.AA): 6 controls
- Awareness and Training (PR.AT): 2 controls
- Data Security (PR.DS): 11 controls (PR.DS-01 through PR.DS-11)
- Information Protection Processes (PR.IP): 4 controls
- Maintenance (PR.MA): 2 controls
- Protective Technology (PR.PT): 4+ controls
Total: 6+2+11+4+2+4 = 29+ controls (need exact count)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 4: DETECT (17+ controls)**
From image analysis:
- Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): 9 controls (DE.CM-01 through DE.CM-09)
- Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE): 8+ controls (DE.AE-02, 03, 04, 06, 07, 08 visible)
Total: 9+8+ = 17+ controls (need exact count)

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 5: RESPOND (15 controls)**
From image analysis:
- Incident Management (RS.MA): 5 controls (RS.MA-01 through RS.MA-05)
- Incident Analysis (RS.AN): 4 controls
- Incident Response Reporting/Communication (RS.CO): 3 controls
- Incident Mitigation (RS.MI): 3 controls
Total: 5+4+3+3 = 15 controls ✓ CONFIRMED

**FUNCTIONAL AREA 6: RECOVER (10+ controls)**
From image analysis:
- Incident Recovery Plan Execution (RC.RP): 6 controls (RC.RP-01 through RC.RP-06)
- Incident Recovery Communication (RC.CO): 4+ controls
Total: 6+4+ = 10+ controls (need exact count)

**UPDATED TOTALS:**
- GOVERN: 32 controls ✓
- IDENTIFY: 21 controls (not 13)
- PROTECT: 25+ controls (not 23, need exact count)
- DETECT: 17+ controls (not 13, need exact count)  
- RESPOND: 15 controls ✓
- RECOVER: 10+ controls (not 11, need exact count)

**CORRECTED STRUCTURE:**
Total appears to be 120+ individual controls across 6 functional areas
This is significantly more than the 106 mentioned in Expel document
Need to verify exact counts for implementation accuracy
