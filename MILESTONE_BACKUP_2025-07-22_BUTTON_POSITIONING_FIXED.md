### USER-IDENTIFIED REMAINING ISSUES ⚠️
1. **Download functionality not working** - buttons rearranged, functionality broken
2. **Schedule functionality not working** - buttons rearranged, functionality broken
3. **Root cause**: Button rearrangement broke the onClick handlers or functionality

### NEXT STEPS (PRP 3.0 INVESTIGATION REQUIRED)
1. Investigate download button functionality in report-display.tsx
2. Investigate schedule button functionality in report-display.tsx  
3. Check if onClick handlers are missing or incorrectly implemented
4. Restore proper functionality without affecting button positioning
5. Test both buttons individually to ensure functionality restored
