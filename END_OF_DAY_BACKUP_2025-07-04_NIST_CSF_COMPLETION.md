# End-of-Day Backup - July 4, 2025
## NIST CSF 2.0 Individual Control Implementation Complete

### Session Summary
**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Session Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Primary Objective**: Complete NIST CSF 2.0 individual control implementation with dropdown selectors

### Completed Work

#### ✅ NIST CSF 2.0 Individual Control Enhancement
- **File Modified**: `client/src/components/rasbita/governance-and-management-assessment.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Replaced placeholder scores with interactive dropdown selectors
  - Added 4-field scoring structure for each individual control (DE.CM-01, DE.AE-02, etc.)
  - Implemented 0-4 score range with 0.5 increments for all fields
  - Set default values: 0 for current/targets, 4 for goal score
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and React rendering issues

#### ✅ Landing Page Content Updates
- **File Modified**: `client/src/components/features-section.tsx`
  - Added "patented quantum-safe encryption" to Core Features section
- **File Modified**: `client/src/components/hero-section.tsx`
  - Updated hero messaging to emphasize proof-based analysis and self-healing capabilities
  - New text: "The only healthcare-focused platform that secures assets through proof-based analysis, self-heals to stop threat actors in real time, and automates compliance — no consultants, no complications."

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Individual Control Scoring Structure
Each NIST CSF 2.0 subcategory control now features:
1. **Score today** - Current implementation level (0-4 with 0.5 increments)
2. **6-month target** - Intermediate milestone (0-4 with 0.5 increments)
3. **12-month target** - Long-term target (0-4 with 0.5 increments)
4. **Goal score** - Ultimate objective (0-4 with 0.5 increments, defaults to 4)

#### NIST CSF 2.0 Structure Preserved
- Complete 108-control structure maintained
- All 6 functional areas with accurate subcategory counts
- Individual control display (DE.CM-01, DE.AE-02, etc.) implemented
- Tier-based scoring system for functional areas preserved

### User Feedback & Clarifications
- User requested dropdown selectors instead of placeholder scores ✅ Completed
- User asked about difference between 6-month target vs 12-month goal tiers
- Explained progression planning: 6-month = achievable milestone, 12-month = ambitious goal
- User confirmed PRP process compliance requirement

### Files Modified
1. `client/src/components/rasbita/governance-and-management-assessment.tsx` - Individual control dropdowns
2. `client/src/components/features-section.tsx` - Quantum-safe encryption text
3. `client/src/components/hero-section.tsx` - Hero section messaging update

### System Status
- Application running successfully on port 5000
- No TypeScript errors or React rendering issues
- All NIST CSF 2.0 controls displaying with functional dropdown selectors
- Landing page updates visible and active
