## PRP 3.0 Protocol Compliance - PRE-WORK BACKUP

### USER REQUEST ANALYSIS
**Requirement:** Add navigation from SOS²A assessment matrix back to the site home page
- Users need ability to return to main cyberlockx.xyz home page from assessment tool
- Current assessment tool may lack clear navigation back to main website

### CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
- Assessment tool currently isolated without clear home page navigation
- Need to add navigation element (likely header/navigation bar) within assessment interface
- Should maintain professional integration with existing assessment UI

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Phase 1:** Analyze current navigation structure
- Check if Header component is available in assessment tool
- Identify best placement for home page navigation
- Ensure navigation doesn't interfere with assessment flow

**Phase 2:** Implement home page navigation
- Add navigation element to assessment interface
- Include CyberLockX branding/logo linking to home
- Maintain clean, professional appearance

**Phase 3:** User verification and testing
- Verify navigation works correctly
- Ensure assessment tool functionality preserved
- Test user experience flow

### FILES TO EXAMINE
- `client/src/pages/sos2a-tool.tsx` - Main assessment interface
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` - Site navigation component
- Current navigation routing structure
