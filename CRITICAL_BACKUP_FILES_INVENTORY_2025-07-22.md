### ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENT
**The Authentic "Marriage of Old and Enhanced" Report System:**
- User confirmed a working version existed with "all the 5 pilars rubrics"
- Combined original detailed analysis with enhanced professional features
- Preserved ALL visual elements including piecharts and scorecards

### üéØ RESTORATION STRATEGY OPTIONS
**Option 1: report-display-clean.tsx (Jul 22 17:45)**
- Most recent working version from today
- 511 lines, includes assessment age tracking
- May contain authentic pre-corruption baseline

**Option 2: Enhanced Integration Approach**  
- Start with report-display-clean.tsx as baseline
- Carefully append ENHANCED_PROFESSIONAL_ANALYSIS_BACKUP_2025-07-22.tsx (514 lines)
- Recreate "marriage of old and enhanced" as user originally had it

**Option 3: Search Deeper for July 20 Version**
- Look for actual component files from July 20, 2025
- The milestone docs reference this date as successful restoration point
