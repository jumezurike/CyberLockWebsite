# PRE-WORK BACKUP - Button Positioning Fix
## Date: July 22, 2025 - 18:13 UTC
## PRP 3.0 Protocol Compliance

### CURRENT SYSTEM STATE
- Assessment loading working correctly (API responses 304 cached)
- Report display functional with enhanced component from recent deployment
- CRITICAL ISSUE: Button positioning incorrect - all buttons centered instead of proper layout
- Download functionality broken due to button rearrangement
- Schedule Comprehensive Assessment functionality broken due to rearrangement

### USER-IDENTIFIED ISSUES
1. **Button Layout Problem**: All buttons currently centered
2. **Required Layout**: 
   - "Back to Matrix Population" button → extreme left
   - "Schedule Comprehensive Assessment" button → extreme right
   - "Download Report" button → extreme right (next to Schedule)
3. **Functionality Issues**: Download and Schedule buttons not working due to rearrangement

### BACKUP VERIFICATION
✅ Current report display backed up
✅ User feedback documented with attached screenshot
✅ Working directory confirmed
✅ Strategic approach requested - slow, methodical fixes

### USER DIRECTIVE
"I will plead that you stick with my speed and not move too fast. I need you to check this first because we must be strategic."

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. Locate button layout code in report-display.tsx
2. Fix positioning: left-align "Back to Matrix Population", right-align other two
3. Restore download functionality
4. Restore schedule functionality
5. Test each button individually before proceeding

### FILES TO BE MODIFIED
- `client/src/components/sos2a/report-display.tsx` (BUTTON LAYOUT FIX)

**PRP 3.0 STATUS:** PRE-WORK BACKUP CREATED AND VERIFIED
