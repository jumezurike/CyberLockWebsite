## THE 5 PILLARS OF CYBERLOCKX SCORECARD

### Pillar 1: Qualitative Assessment
**Foundation pillar based on expert analysis**
- Based on expert opinions and observational analysis
- Covers all 12 default parameters (Infrastructure, Security Risks, Baseline Configuration, etc.)
- Forms the foundation of the assessment process
- In preliminary assessments, this relies primarily on questionnaire responses
- **Always Present** - Core evaluation methodology

### Pillar 2: Quantitative Analysis
**Evidence-based validation pillar**
- Uses professional scanning tools to gather measurable data
- Involves the 18 deep scan parameters (Vulnerability Management, Phishing & Email Security, etc.)
- Provides evidence-based validation of the qualitative assessment
- Requires 6 months of evidence collection for the comprehensive report
- **Comprehensive Reports Only** - Long-term data collection required

### Pillar 3: RASBITA Cost-Benefit Analysis (RASBITA-CBF)
**Financial modeling and business case pillar**
- Financial modeling of security risks and investments using NRRB calculations
- **Core Formula:** NRRB = (Risk Reduction Value) - (Total Cost of Safeguards)
- **Asset Purchasing Decision Framework:** Positive NRRB justifies purchase, negative requires additional justification
- Includes metrics like:
  - Total Asset Value (actual purchase cost or current market value)
  - Total Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) using ALE = SLE × ARO
  - Total Cost of Safeguards (purchase + implementation + maintenance + operational)
  - Net Risk Reduction Benefit (NRRB) - core justification metric
- **Architecture Diagram Dependency:** Required for accurate data flow and asset relationship analysis
  - **Flexibility:** If unavailable, process continues with annotation that architectural diagram dependency was exempted
- **SMB Reality:** Most organizations lack breach/incident record keeping at time of assessment
- **Incident-Based Calculation:** If incident discovered within 12 months during inquiry, immediate breach scenario applies using ALE formula
- **Business-Focused** - ROI and financial justification for security asset purchases

### Pillar 4: RASBITA Governance & Management
**Organizational maturity pillar**
- Assesses maturity in governing and managing cybersecurity risks
- Uses GPA-style scoring system (0-4.0 scale)
- Focuses on the "Govern," "Identify," and "Protect" domains from NIST CSF 2.0
- Evaluates how well security is managed at an organizational level
- **Management Excellence** - Organizational capability assessment

### Pillar 5: Architecture Threat Modeling & App Sec
**Technical security architecture pillar**
- Thorough data flow diagram analysis
- Comprehensive STRIDE threat modeling
- Validated mitigation strategies
- Architectural security validation
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Provides complete application security assessment integrated with architecture analysis
- Maps security controls to specific threats and application vulnerabilities
- **Technical Excellence** - Deep technical security validation

## RASBITA-CBF FINANCIAL MODELING METHODOLOGY

### Core ALE Calculation Framework
**Formula:** `ALE = SLE × ARO`

Where:
- **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)** - Expected annual financial loss from a risk
- **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** - Estimated cost of a single occurrence of a specific risk  
- **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)** - Estimated frequency of that risk occurring within a year

### Asset Valuation Methods
**Total Asset Value Options:**
- Actual purchase cost (when asset was acquired)
- Current market value (present-day replacement cost)
- **Business Decision:** Organization selects method based on business justification approach

### SMB Assessment Reality
**Record Keeping Challenge:**
- Most SMB organizations lack formal breach/incident documentation
- Historical data typically unavailable at time of assessment
- Creates dependency on immediate/recent incident discovery

**Incident-Based Calculation Trigger:**
- If incident discovered within 12 months during Phase 1-2 inquiry
- Immediate breach scenario classification applies
- ALE calculation becomes mandatory using discovered incident data
- Transforms theoretical risk into actual loss experience

### NRRB Asset Purchasing Decision Matrix
**Positive NRRB (> 0):**
- Security asset reduces more risk cost than implementation cost
- Clear financial justification for purchase
- Immediate business case approval

**Negative NRRB (< 0):**
- Asset costs exceed risk reduction value
- Requires additional business justification:
  - Compliance requirements
  - Regulatory mandates
  - Strategic security posture improvements
  - Brand/reputation protection

**Zero NRRB (= 0):**
- Break-even scenario
- Decision based on strategic factors
- Risk tolerance considerations

### Architecture Diagram Integration
**Required for Accurate Assessment:**
- Data flow analysis for asset interdependencies
- Risk propagation calculations
- Attack path vulnerability assessment

**Exemption Process:**
- Clear documentation when diagrams unavailable
- Annotation in assessment report
- Process continuation with noted limitations
- No impact on overall assessment validity

## CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS & INTEGRATION POINTS

### Qualitative → Quantitative Validation Process
- The 18 scanning parameters provide quantitative evidence to validate the qualitative assessments from the 12 default parameters
- The comprehensive report process uses this validation through 6 months of evidence collection
- Transforms initial qualitative assessment into verified quantitative assessment

### 6-Month Comprehensive Assessment Requirements
**Enhanced device inventory tracking capabilities needed:**
- Better track changes over time
- Show device security posture improvement  
- Document applied patches and controls
- Track when devices are brought into SOC monitoring
- Record final deep scan results at the end of the monitoring period

**Required display components:**
- Before/after security posture metrics for each device
- Trend analysis showing improvement over the 6-month period
- Patch history and compliance status
- Integration with the SOC monitoring data

## PROCESS INTEGRITY & FLEXIBILITY NOTES

### Architecture Threat Modeling Flexibility
- Phase 7 can be skipped if organization prefers
- Clear documentation that this does not affect overall score since the value wasn't included
- Still emphasized as important for security strength
- Maintains assessment integrity while respecting organizational preferences

### Assessment Flow Integrity  
- Each phase builds upon previous phases
- Matrix population (Phase 3) structures all subsequent analysis
- Gap analysis (Phase 6) integrates AI agents with human expert knowledge
- Comprehensive report (Phase 9) validates all previous qualitative work with quantitative evidence
