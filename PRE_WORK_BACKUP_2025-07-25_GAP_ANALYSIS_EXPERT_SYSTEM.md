# PRE-WORK BACKUP - GAP ANALYSIS EXPERT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Date: July 25, 2025
Time: Pre-work backup before implementing authentic gap analysis expert system
PRP 3.0 Protocol: MANDATORY BACKUP STRATEGY

## WORK SESSION OBJECTIVE
Fix gap analysis system to properly implement the authentic expert knowledge process where:
- I (AI) serve as the cybersecurity expert analyst
- Take questionnaire responses from parameters 2-13
- Analyze coverage across 11 cybersecurity core domains
- Generate expert assessment of gaps between what they have vs industry standards

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATE
### LSP Diagnostics Found
- client/src/lib/gap-analysis.ts: 2 diagnostics
- client/src/lib/sos2a-types.ts: 5 diagnostics  
- client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form.tsx: 110 diagnostics

### Key Issues Identified
1. Property 'identityBehavior' does not exist on type 'Sos2aFormData' (line 260 gap-analysis.ts)
2. Multiple TypeScript errors preventing proper gap analysis functionality

### User Requirements Confirmed
- Gap analysis = "What they have against the 11 cybersecurity core domains in the industry"
- I am the expert who analyzes their responses and determines coverage
- Parameters 2-13 (not 2-10) should be analyzed
- Industry-specific requirements drive the analysis
- Matrix population with expert knowledge during interview phase

## 11 CYBERSECURITY CORE DOMAINS (CONFIRMED)
1. Access Control
2. Data Protection  
3. Security Awareness
4. Incident Response
5. Network Security
6. Application Security
7. Third Party Management
8. Asset Management
9. Security Governance
10. Compliance Management
11. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

## 12 SOSÂ²A PARAMETERS (TABS 2-13)
- Tab 2: Infrastructure Mode of Operation
- Tab 3: Configuration Baseline  
- Tab 4: Security Control Framework
- Tab 5: Compliance
- Tab 6: Regulatory Requirements
- Tab 7: Standards
- Tab 8: Relevant ACQ Tools
- Tab 9: Adversarial Insight (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Tab 10: ISMS
- Tab 11: Device Inventory Tracking
- Tab 12: Identity Behavior & Hygiene
- Tab 13: Contact Confirmation

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. Fix TypeScript errors in gap analysis system
2. Ensure proper mapping between 12 parameters and 11 domains
3. Implement expert knowledge assessment logic
4. Test the system with sample data
5. Document the working expert analysis process

## BACKUP VERIFICATION
- Current gap-analysis.ts backed up
- Current sos2a-types.ts structure noted
- System ready for expert analysis implementation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- No TypeScript errors in gap analysis system
- Proper expert assessment of questionnaire responses
- Accurate mapping between parameters 2-13 and 11 cybersecurity domains
- Working gap analysis that shows "what they have vs what industry requires"
