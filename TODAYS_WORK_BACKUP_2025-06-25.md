# Today's Work Backup - June 25, 2025

## Critical Functional Enhancements Completed Today
âœ… **IAM Added as 11th Parameter to Gap Analysis System**
- Successfully integrated Identity and Access Management (IAM) as parameter #11
- Updated gap analysis scoring distribution to accommodate 11 parameters (~9.09% each)
- Enhanced parameter mapping system with IAM validation

## Key Files with Today's Improvements
- client/src/lib/gap-analysis.ts - IAM parameter integration
- client/src/lib/gap-analysis-types.ts - Type definitions updated
- client/src/components/sos2a/gap-analysis.tsx - UI components updated
- client/src/lib/qualitative-analysis-integration.ts - IAM scoring integration

## Problem Identified
- Form submission functionality broken due to interface changes
- Original deployed version interface compromised
- Need to preserve today's IAM work while restoring original UI

## Next Steps
- Restore original deployed interface design
- Preserve IAM functionality from today's work
- Ensure submit button works correctly
- Maintain all existing assessment data integrity
