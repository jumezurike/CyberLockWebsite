// BACKUP OF INCORRECTLY ADDED FORMS 7-10 - 2025-06-03
// These were added without user approval and need to be replaced with authentic content

Forms I incorrectly added:
7. Session Management - NOT from user specifications
8. Account Management - NOT from user specifications  
9. Privacy & Data Protection - NOT from user specifications

3. Access & Permissions (needs to be added)
4. Identity Protection ✓ (already exists)
