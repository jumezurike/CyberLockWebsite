# COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS - Production vs Current Systems
Date: 2025-07-25
Status: CRITICAL TYPE MISMATCH IDENTIFIED

## File Size Comparison
- Production sos2a-tool.tsx: 2635 lines
- Current sos2a-tool.tsx: 698 lines (TRUNCATED - missing 1937 lines)

- Production report-display.tsx: 1974 lines  
- Current report-display.tsx: 511 lines (TRUNCATED - missing 1463 lines)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Type Import Location Issue
- Production: `GapAnalysisResult` from `@/lib/sos2a-types`
- Current: `GapAnalysisResult` from `@/lib/gap-analysis-types` 

### 2. Score Calculation Issue (CRITICAL)
- Production: `result.overallScore.percentage` ✅ (proper 5-pillar weighting)
- Current: `result.overallGapPercentage || 75` ❌ (incorrect fallback)

### 3. Missing Visual Elements
Both files severely truncated - missing extensive UI components that provide:
- Complete assessment workflow interface
- Professional report display with "marriage of old and enhanced"
- Comprehensive modal dialogs and interactions
- Full scorecard and visual elements

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
1. Fix type imports to match production structure
2. Replace overallGapPercentage with overallScore.percentage
3. Restore production functionality while preserving file protection system
