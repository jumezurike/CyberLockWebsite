# MILESTONE BACKUP - Design Restoration 50% Complete
## Date: July 22, 2025 - 18:59
## PRP 3.0 Milestone Checkpoint - Analysis Complete

### ANALYSIS FINDINGS ✅
**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- Current `report-display.tsx` has been modified with jsPDF imports and new download functionality
- The working "marriage of old and enhanced" was in `report-display.tsx` (lines 1714-2026) as of 15:50 merge
- The `enhanced-report-display.tsx` is a separate component but not being used in the current flow
- User wants to return to the design that was working earlier today with enhanced professional analysis preserved

### RESTORATION STRATEGY ✅
1. **Preserve Enhanced Professional Analysis**: Keep the 5-tab enhanced content from merge complete
2. **Restore Working Design**: Return to the visual layout that was working at 15:50
3. **Fix Button Functionality**: Restore working download and schedule functions
4. **Keep Button Positioning**: Maintain the fixed button layout (left: Back, right: Download/Schedule)

### BACKUP TIMELINE ANALYSIS
- **15:50 - MERGE_COMPLETE**: "Marriage of old and enhanced" working perfectly
- **15:15 - 75_PERCENT_DEPLOYMENT**: Enhanced system fully operational  
- **18:37 - BUTTON_POSITIONING**: Button layout fixed but functionality broken
- **18:45+ - CURRENT**: jsPDF modifications causing deviation from working design

### RESTORATION PLAN
1. Restore report-display.tsx to the working merge complete version (15:50)
2. Apply the button positioning fix (18:37) 
3. Keep the enhanced professional analysis tabs and content
4. Restore the working download functionality from the merge complete version
5. Test functionality to ensure complete restoration

### NEXT STEPS
