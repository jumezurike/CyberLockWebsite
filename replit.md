# CyberLockX (HASH) - Universal Identification Verification System

## Project Overview
Advanced cybersecurity platform featuring the HOS²A (Healthcare Organizational and System Security Analysis) assessment tool with RASBITA framework. The system provides comprehensive digital identity management and security risk assessment with flexible, user-centric identification processes.

**Core Technologies:**
- React.js with TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Digital Data Nucleic Authority (DDNA) framework for security risk mapping
- Universal Wallet Address (UWA) generation system

## Recent Changes

### June 25, 2025 - Strategic Interface Restoration & IAM Preservation
✅ **Critical System Recovery Completed**
- Successfully restored original deployed interface from `temp_june8_production.tsx`
- Preserved today's IAM functionality as 11th parameter in gap analysis system
- Implemented comprehensive backup strategy to prevent future data loss
- Fixed submit questionnaire functionality while maintaining interface integrity

✅ **Comprehensive Backup System Created**
- `STRATEGIC_BACKUP_2025-06-25.tsx` - Complete working questionnaire form with original interface
- `GAP_ANALYSIS_WITH_IAM_BACKUP_2025-06-25.ts` - Gap analysis with 11 parameters including IAM
- `GAP_ANALYSIS_TYPES_WITH_IAM_BACKUP_2025-06-25.ts` - Supporting type definitions
- `COMPLETE_RESTORATION_GUIDE_2025-06-25.md` - Detailed restoration instructions

✅ **IAM Integration Preserved**
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) successfully maintained as parameter #11
- Updated scoring distribution to ~9.09% across 11 parameters
- Enhanced parameter mapping system intact
- All functional improvements from today's work preserved

**Critical Learning:** Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) violation led to interface damage. Comprehensive backup strategy now implemented to preserve both original quality and functional enhancements for future development.

### June 13, 2025 - Avatar Identity Type Implementation
✅ **Avatar Identity Type Integration Completed**
- Added Avatar identity type to section #13 Identity Behavior dropdown
- Implemented Picture identification method as Avatar-specific option
- Configured Avatar as Intermediate component category in UWA system
- Enhanced UWA component matrix with Avatar-specific components (avatarPicture, pictureHash)
- Updated Records Management interface with Avatar filtering capabilities

### Previous Enhancements
✅ **Unix-Based OS Header Enhancement**
- Added prominent blue "includes macOS" badge for visual clarity
- Enhanced OS category presentation in assessment forms

## Project Architecture

### Identity Management System
- **Universal Identity Verification System (UIVS)** with comprehensive identity type support
- **Digital Data Nucleic Authority (DDNA)** framework for security risk mapping
- **Universal Wallet Address (UWA)** generation from identity + identification components

### Supported Identity Types
1. **Human** - Personal user identities
2. **Machine Physical** - Hardware-based system identities
3. **Machine Virtual** - Virtualized system identities
4. **Avatar** - Digital avatar identities (NEW - Intermediate component)
5. **API** - Application programming interface identities
6. **Third-Party** - External service identities

### Component Categories
- **Identity Components** - Core identity attributes
- **Authentication Components** - Verification mechanisms
- **Identification Components** - Recognition methods
- **Intermediate Components** - Avatar-specific components (NEW)
- **Authorization Components** - Permission systems
- **Technical Components** - System-level identifiers

## User Preferences
- Historical data integrity is paramount - never modify authentic data
- Follow Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) 2.0 for all changes (MANDATORY BACKUP STRATEGY)
- Require explicit user approval before implementing updates
- Maintain exact interface preservation for production system

## Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) 2.0 - MANDATORY BACKUP STRATEGY
**Phase 1: Pre-Work Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Create timestamped backup of all critical files before ANY changes
- Document current system state and working directory
- Verify backup integrity before proceeding
- **NO WORK WITHOUT BACKUP**

**Phase 2: Milestone Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Create incremental backups at significant development milestones
- Document what was accomplished and what's next
- Preserve working states for potential rollback points

**Phase 3: End-of-Day Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Comprehensive backup of all modified files
- Complete documentation update in replit.md
- Create restoration guide for next session

## Critical Constraints
- This is a live production system requiring exact interface preservation
- Historical data integrity must be maintained at all times
- All changes require explicit user confirmation before implementation
- Authentication data timestamps must remain authentic and unmodified
