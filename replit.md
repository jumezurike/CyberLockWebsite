## User Preferences
- Historical data integrity is paramount - never modify authentic data
- Follow Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) 2.0 for all changes (MANDATORY BACKUP STRATEGY)
- Require explicit user approval before implementing updates
- Maintain exact interface preservation for production system

## Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) 2.0 - MANDATORY BACKUP STRATEGY

**Phase 1: Pre-Work Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Create timestamped backup of all critical files before ANY changes
- Document current system state and working directory
- Verify backup integrity before proceeding
- **NO WORK WITHOUT BACKUP**

**Phase 2: Milestone Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Create incremental backups at significant development milestones
- Document what was accomplished and what's next
- Preserve working states for potential rollback points
- Update replit.md with progress and backup locations

**Phase 3: End-of-Day Backup (REQUIRED)**
- Comprehensive backup of all modified files
- Complete documentation update in replit.md
- Create restoration guide for next session
- Test backup integrity before session end

**BACKUP NAMING CONVENTION**
```
PRE_WORK_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.tsx
MILESTONE_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_DESCRIPTION.tsx
END_OF_DAY_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD.tsx
RESTORATION_GUIDE_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

**MANDATORY CHECKS**
1. ✅ Pre-work backup created and verified
2. ✅ Working directory confirmed
3. ✅ User approval for changes obtained
4. ✅ Milestone backups at 25%, 50%, 75% completion
5. ✅ End-of-day comprehensive backup
6. ✅ Restoration documentation updated

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**
- Any work without proper backup is considered CRITICAL PRP VIOLATION
- Immediate work stoppage and backup creation required
- System restoration from last known good backup
- Re-documentation of all progress lost

**IMPLEMENTATION COMMITMENT**
This PRP 2.0 is now MANDATORY for all future work sessions. No exceptions.

**BACKUP VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**
- Pre-work backup timestamp matches session start
- Milestone backups contain incremental progress
- End-of-day backup includes all modifications
- Restoration guide updated with current session details
- All backup files verified for integrity and completeness

## Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) 3.0 - STRATEGIC PROBLEM RESOLUTION

**1. STRATEGIC PROBLEM ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)**
When encountering any problem, follow this structured approach:

**A. Problem Genesis/Development Roadmap**
- Document the complete development timeline leading to the issue
- Identify all decisions and changes that contributed to current state
- Map the logical progression from initial design to problem manifestation
- Record all stakeholders and dependencies involved

**B. Problem Root Cause Analysis**
- Systematic investigation of underlying causes (not just symptoms)
- Technical analysis of code, architecture, and system interactions
- Process analysis of development workflow and decision points
- Documentation of all contributing factors and their relationships

**C. Solution Initialization/Roadmap to Success**
- Comprehensive solution strategy with multiple approaches
- Risk assessment for each proposed solution path
- Timeline and resource requirements for implementation
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- Rollback procedures if solution fails

**USER EVALUATION CHECKPOINT**
After completing A, B, and C analysis, present findings for user evaluation.
User may request modifications to understanding before proceeding.
**NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (DR/BC) Framework

**2. FILE MANAGEMENT & RECOVERY PROTOCOLS**

**A. Daily Milestone Backup System**
- Automated backup at each significant development milestone
- Timestamped incremental backups throughout development sessions
- Backup verification and integrity checks before proceeding

**B. Deduplication Policy (MANDATORY)**
- Daily cleanup of duplicate files and obsolete backups
- Systematic removal of temporary files and debugging artifacts
- Maintenance of clean, organized file structure
- Preservation only of essential and unique files

**C. Work Documentation Protocol**
- Generate comprehensive work report: JU<DEV/PRO><YYYYMMDD><HHMM>PR.txt
- Include detailed description of all changes made
- Document impact on related project components
- Provide clear context for future developers and sessions
- Maintain continuity documentation for seamless handoffs

**D. Git Backup & Deployment History Verification**
- **MANDATORY**: Check git history and deployment status before starting work
- Identify last known good deployment version
- Document available backup points and their timestamps
- Verify backup integrity before beginning development

**E. Deployment-Based Backup Policy**
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Backups older than current deployment are PROHIBITED
- Only use backups created after or concurrent with deployed version
- Prevent regression by enforcing forward-compatibility
- Eliminate time-wasting attempts to restore outdated functionality

**F. Application Architecture Documentation**
- Maintain comprehensive class diagram of all functions and components
- Document main application aspects and their relationships
- Provide both written specifications and visual diagrams
- Update architecture documentation with each significant change
- Ensure documentation clarity for team understanding and continuity

## Critical Constraints
- This is a live production system requiring exact interface preservation
- Historical data integrity must be maintained at all times
- All changes require explicit user confirmation before implementation
- Authentication data timestamps must remain authentic and unmodified
