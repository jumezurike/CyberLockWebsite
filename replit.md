# CyberLockX (HASH) - Universal Identification Verification System

## Project Overview
Advanced cybersecurity platform featuring the HOS²A (Healthcare Organizational and System Security Analysis) assessment tool with RASBITA framework. The system provides comprehensive digital identity management and security risk assessment with flexible, user-centric identification processes.

**Core Technologies:**
- React.js with TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Digital Data Nucleic Authority (DDNA) framework for security risk mapping
- Universal Wallet Address (UWA) generation system

## Recent Changes

### June 13, 2025 - Avatar Identity Type Implementation
✅ **Avatar Identity Type Integration Completed**
- Added Avatar identity type to section #13 Identity Behavior dropdown
- Implemented Picture identification method as Avatar-specific option
- Configured Avatar as Intermediate component category in UWA system
- Enhanced UWA component matrix with Avatar-specific components (avatarPicture, pictureHash)
- Updated Records Management interface with Avatar filtering capabilities

✅ **Navigation Button Consistency Enhancement**
- Updated sections #12, #13, and #14 navigation buttons to use extreme opposite positioning
- Changed from `justify-end space-x-4` to `justify-between` layout
- Previous Step button now positioned on far left, Next Step button on far right
- Consistent spacing and positioning across all assessment sections

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form.tsx` - Updated navigation button layouts for sections #12, #13, #14

### Previous Enhancements
✅ **Unix-Based OS Header Enhancement**
- Added prominent blue "includes macOS" badge for visual clarity
- Enhanced OS category presentation in assessment forms

## Project Architecture

### Identity Management System
- **Universal Identity Verification System (UIVS)** with comprehensive identity type support
- **Digital Data Nucleic Authority (DDNA)** framework for security risk mapping
- **Universal Wallet Address (UWA)** generation from identity + identification components

### Supported Identity Types
1. **Human** - Personal user identities
2. **Machine Physical** - Hardware-based system identities
3. **Machine Virtual** - Virtualized system identities
4. **Avatar** - Digital avatar identities (NEW - Intermediate component)
5. **API** - Application programming interface identities
6. **Third-Party** - External service identities

### Component Categories
- **Identity Components** - Core identity attributes
- **Authentication Components** - Verification mechanisms
- **Identification Components** - Recognition methods
- **Intermediate Components** - Avatar-specific components (NEW)
- **Authorization Components** - Permission systems
- **Technical Components** - System-level identifiers

## User Preferences
- Historical data integrity is paramount - never modify authentic data
- Follow Problem Resolution Protocol (PRP) for all changes
- Require explicit user approval before implementing updates
- Maintain exact interface preservation for production system

## Critical Constraints
- This is a live production system requiring exact interface preservation
- Historical data integrity must be maintained at all times
- All changes require explicit user confirmation before implementation
- Authentication data timestamps must remain authentic and unmodified
