## Application Organization Requirements
All applications must be easily located and organized for agility:

### Core Application Structure
```
client/src/components/sos2a/          [PRIMARY INTERFACE]
client/src/lib/                       [ANALYSIS & LOGIC]
client/src/pages/                     [APPLICATION ENTRY]
server/                               [BACKEND SERVICES]
shared/                               [DATABASE SCHEMA]
```

### Quick Access Development Map
- **Interface Changes:** `client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form.tsx`
- **Analysis Logic:** `client/src/lib/gap-analysis.ts`
- **Database Schema:** `shared/schema.ts`
- **API Routes:** `server/routes.ts`

### Emergency Recovery Points
1. **Interface Issues:** Use `STRATEGIC_BACKUP_2025-06-25.tsx`
2. **Analysis Issues:** Use `GAP_ANALYSIS_WITH_IAM_BACKUP_2025-06-25.ts`
3. **Complete System:** Use `END_OF_DAY_BACKUP_2025-06-25.tsx`

## Backup Naming Convention
```
PRE_WORK_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.tsx
MILESTONE_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_DESCRIPTION.tsx
END_OF_DAY_BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD.tsx
RESTORATION_GUIDE_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## Mandatory Checks
1. ✅ Pre-work backup created and verified
2. ✅ Working directory confirmed
3. ✅ User approval for changes obtained
4. ✅ Milestone backups at 25%, 50%, 75% completion
5. ✅ End-of-day comprehensive backup
6. ✅ Restoration documentation updated

## Violation Consequences
- Any work without proper backup is considered CRITICAL PRP VIOLATION
- Immediate work stoppage and backup creation required
- System restoration from last known good backup
- Re-documentation of all progress lost

## Backup Verification Checklist
- Pre-work backup timestamp matches session start
- Milestone backups contain incremental progress
- End-of-day backup includes all modifications
- Restoration guide updated with current session details
- All backup files verified for integrity and completeness

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Strategic Approach**: Problem Genesis → Root Cause → Solution Roadmap
2. **User Approval**: No implementation without explicit user authorization
3. **Backup Integrity**: Comprehensive backup verification at all stages
4. **File Organization**: Systematic structure for enhanced development agility
5. **Deployment Safety**: Only use backups newer than deployed version
6. **Documentation**: Complete work documentation for continuity

## Critical Constraints
- This is a live production system requiring exact interface preservation
- Historical data integrity must be maintained at all times
- All changes require explicit user confirmation before implementation
- Authentication data timestamps must remain authentic and unmodified
