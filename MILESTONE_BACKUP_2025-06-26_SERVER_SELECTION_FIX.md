# Milestone Backup - Server Selection Fix
Date: June 26, 2025 | Time: 17:32
Status: Device Type Fix Applied to June 25th Base

## Changes Made
✅ Restored from END_OF_DAY_BACKUP_2025-06-25.tsx (clean base with all improvements)
✅ Applied surgical fix to Device Type server selection in section #12
✅ Fixed array handling: field.value?.filter() || [] → (field.value || []).filter()

## Integration Safety Measures
- Used June 25th backup as stable foundation
- Applied only targeted fix to specific checkbox issue
- Preserved all IAM functionality and qualitative analysis improvements
- No wholesale changes to other form sections

## Backup Location
Current working file: client/src/components/sos2a/questionnaire-form.tsx
Previous stable: END_OF_DAY_BACKUP_2025-06-25.tsx

## Next Steps
- Verify Device Type "Server" selection works
- Test other form sections for regression
- Create final backup if all tests pass
