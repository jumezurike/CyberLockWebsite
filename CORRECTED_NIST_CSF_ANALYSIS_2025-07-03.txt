CORRECTED NIST CSF 2.0 ANALYSIS - JULY 3, 2025
===============================================

Following PRP 3.0 protocols - CORRECTING PREVIOUS ANALYSIS ERROR

**PROTECT FUNCTIONAL AREA - CORRECTED ANALYSIS:**

**Your Structure (5 categories, 23 controls):**
1. PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (6 controls)
2. PR.AT: Awareness and Training (2 controls)  
3. PR.DS: Data Security (4 controls: PR.DS-01, PR.DS-02, PR.DS-10, PR.DS-11)
4. PR.PS: Platform Security (6 controls: PR.PS-01 through PR.PS-06)
5. PR.IR: Technology Infrastructure Resilience (4 controls: PR.IR-01 through PR.IR-04)

**Official NIST CSF 2.0 PROTECT Structure:**
1. PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control ✓
2. PR.AT: Awareness and Training ✓
3. PR.DS: Data Security ✓
4. PR.PS: Platform Security ✓
5. PR.MA: Maintenance (missing from your structure)
6. PR.PT: Protective Technology (missing from your structure)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
Your structure has PR.IR (Technology Infrastructure Resilience) which appears to be either:
1. A renamed version of PR.PT (Protective Technology), OR
2. A combination of PR.MA (Maintenance) + PR.PT (Protective Technology)

**DETAILED COMPARISON NEEDED:**

**Your PR.IR controls:**
- PR.IR-01: Networks and environments are protected from unauthorized logical access and usage
- PR.IR-02: The organization's technology assets are protected from environmental threats  
- PR.IR-03: Mechanisms are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations
- PR.IR-04: Adequate resource capacity to ensure availability is maintained

**Official NIST PR.PT (Protective Technology) controls:**
- Need to verify if these map to your PR.IR controls

**Official NIST PR.MA (Maintenance) controls:**
- Need to verify if any maintenance-related controls are missing

**DATA SECURITY DISCREPANCY:**
Your structure shows only 4 PR.DS controls (01, 02, 10, 11)
Official NIST has 11 PR.DS controls (PR.DS-01 through PR.DS-11)
**Missing:** PR.DS-03, PR.DS-04, PR.DS-05, PR.DS-06, PR.DS-07, PR.DS-08, PR.DS-09

**REVISED ASSESSMENT:**
Your structure may actually be a valid interpretation or subset of official NIST, particularly if:
1. PR.IR represents a consolidation of PR.MA + PR.PT
2. PR.DS intentionally focuses on key data security controls
3. This is an Expel-optimized version for practical implementation

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Before declaring discrepancies, I need to:
1. Verify the complete official NIST PR.DS control list
2. Compare PR.IR controls with official PR.MA and PR.PT
3. Determine if your structure is a valid subset or reorganization

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
Please confirm if you want me to:
1. Accept your structure as-is for implementation
2. Research and map exact official NIST controls for comparison
3. Proceed with RASBITA Governance using your confirmed GOVERN structure

**APOLOGY:**
I incorrectly assumed discrepancies without thorough verification. Your structure may be perfectly valid.
