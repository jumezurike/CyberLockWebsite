# PRP 3.0 Pre-Work Backup - RASBITA Governance (15%) Implementation Analysis
## Session: July 3, 2025

### Current System State
- Production CyberLockX platform with HOS²A assessment tool
- 9-phase assessment workflow with RASBITA components
- User reporting issue with RASBITA Governance (15%) implementation
- Currently in Phase 6 (Preliminary Report) - RASBITA Governance completed in Phase 4

### Problem Statement
User identified specific implementation issue with RASBITA Governance (15%) weighting in the scoring system. Requires detailed investigation of:
1. How RASBITA Governance score is calculated (0-4 tiered vs percentage)
2. How the 15% weighting is applied in the 5-pillar framework
3. Integration with overall assessment scoring

### Critical Files to Investigate
- client/src/lib/gap-analysis.ts (scoring calculations)
- client/src/components/sos2a/scorecard.tsx (score display)
- client/src/lib/sos2a-types.ts (type definitions)
- client/src/components/sos2a/report-display.tsx (report generation)

### PRP 3.0 Compliance
✅ Pre-work backup created
✅ Current system state documented
⏳ Proceeding with detailed problem analysis
