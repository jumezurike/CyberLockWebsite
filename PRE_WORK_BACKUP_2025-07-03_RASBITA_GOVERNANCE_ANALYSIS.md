PRE-WORK BACKUP - JULY 3, 2025 - RASBITA GOVERNANCE ANALYSIS
=============================================================

**SESSION START:** 2025-07-03
**OBJECTIVE:** Implement RASBITA Governance (15%) using hybrid Expel + NIST CSF 2.0 approach
**PRP 3.0 PROTOCOL:** MANDATORY BACKUP BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

**CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:**
- CyberLockX HOS²A assessment tool operational
- 5-pillar framework established (Qualitative 20%, Quantitative 25%, RASBITA CBF 25%, RASBITA Governance 15%, Architecture 15%)
- GOVERN structure verified perfect match with NIST CSF 2.0 (32 controls)
- Hybrid approach approved for Expel format + NIST completeness

**CRITICAL FILES BACKED UP:**
- client/src/lib/rasbita-preliminary-scoring.ts
- client/src/lib/five-pillar-scorecard.ts
- shared/schema.ts
- All questionnaire forms and assessment components

**ANALYSIS COMPLETED:**
- Extracted all 9 NIST CSF 2.0 worksheets from Excel
- Verified GOVERN (32 controls) perfect match
- Identified structural discrepancies in PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, RECOVER
- Created comprehensive hybrid implementation plan
- User approved hybrid approach: "Use the expel format but include NIST CSF"

**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:**
1. Create RASBITA Governance scoring system using verified GOVERN structure
2. Implement 5-tier scoring (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) across 32 controls
3. Integrate with existing 5-pillar framework
4. Test with current assessment data
5. Gradually enhance other functional areas with NIST completeness

**BACKUP VERIFICATION:** ✅ COMPLETED
**USER APPROVAL:** ✅ OBTAINED
**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION:** ✅ CONFIRMED

**NEXT ACTIONS:**
- Implement RASBITA Governance (15%) scoring system
- Create comprehensive work documentation in JUDev format
- Follow PRP 3.0 milestone backup protocols
