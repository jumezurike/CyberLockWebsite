# PRE-WORK BACKUP - Return to Matrix Navigation Enhancement
## Date: July 22, 2025 - 15:49 UTC
## PRP 3.0 Protocol Compliance - PRE-WORK BACKUP

### USER REQUEST ANALYSIS
**Requirement:** "Return to Matrix" button should navigate back to the complete assessment interface including:
- Healthcare Organizational and System Security Analysis (HOS²A) header
- Search Assessments functionality with company name, date filters
- Assessment History with 5 reports selection
- Assessment Progress tracking (9-step process)
- Complete questionnaire sections (1-15)
- Business Information form

### CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
- Report display currently shows "Return to Matrix" button
- Need to verify current navigation behavior
- Need to ensure return leads to full assessment interface, not partial view

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Phase 1:** Analyze current navigation structure
- Check current "Return to Matrix" button implementation
- Verify target navigation route and component structure
- Identify if returning to `/sos2a-tool` shows complete interface

**Phase 2:** Fix navigation if needed
- Ensure return navigates to complete assessment tool interface
- Verify all components load properly: search, history, progress, questionnaire
- Test navigation flow and user experience

**Phase 3:** User verification
- Request user approval for navigation behavior
- Confirm complete interface visibility after return navigation

### FILES TO EXAMINE
- `client/src/components/sos2a/report-display.tsx` - Current return button
- `client/src/pages/sos2a-tool.tsx` - Main assessment interface
- Navigation routing logic
