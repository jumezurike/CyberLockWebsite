NIST CSF 2.0 DISCREPANCY CORRECTION PLAN - JULY 3, 2025
=========================================================

Following PRP 3.0 protocols - AWAITING USER APPROVAL before implementation

**CURRENT STATUS:**
✅ GOVERN (32 controls) - Perfect match with official NIST
✅ IDENTIFY (21 controls) - Perfect match with official NIST
⚠️ PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, RECOVER - Discrepancies found

**DISCREPANCY DETAILS & PROPOSED CORRECTIONS:**

**1. PROTECT FUNCTIONAL AREA DISCREPANCY**
-------------------------------------------
**Current User Structure (5 categories):**
- PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control ✓
- PR.AT: Awareness and Training ✓  
- PR.DS: Data Security ✓
- PR.PS: Platform Security ✓
- PR.IR: Technology Infrastructure Resilience ✓

**Official NIST CSF 2.0 Structure (6 categories):**
- PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control ✓
- PR.AT: Awareness and Training ✓
- PR.DS: Data Security ✓
- PR.PS: Platform Security ✓ (User has this)
- PR.MA: Maintenance ❌ MISSING
- PR.PT: Protective Technology ❌ MISSING (User has PR.IR instead)

**PROPOSED CORRECTION:**
Replace: PR.IR (Technology Infrastructure Resilience)
Add: PR.MA (Maintenance) + PR.PT (Protective Technology)

**2. DETECT FUNCTIONAL AREA DISCREPANCY**
-----------------------------------------
**Current User Structure (2 categories):**
- DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring ✓
- DE.AE: Adverse Event Analysis ✓

**Official NIST CSF 2.0 Structure (3 categories):**
- DE.AE: Anomalies and Events ✓ (slight name difference)
- DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring ✓
- DE.DP: Detection Processes ❌ MISSING

**PROPOSED CORRECTION:**
Add: DE.DP (Detection Processes)
Rename: "Adverse Event Analysis" → "Anomalies and Events"

**3. RESPOND FUNCTIONAL AREA DISCREPANCY**
------------------------------------------
**Current User Structure (4 categories):**
- RS.MA: Incident Management ✓ (name difference)
- RS.AN: Incident Analysis ✓ (name difference)
- RS.CO: Incident Response Reporting and Communication ❌ Wrong code
- RS.MI: Incident Mitigation ✓ (name difference)

**Official NIST CSF 2.0 Structure (4 categories):**
- RS.MA: Management ✓
- RS.AN: Analysis ✓
- RS.MI: Mitigation ✓
- RS.RP: Reporting ❌ User uses RS.CO instead

**PROPOSED CORRECTION:**
Change: RS.CO → RS.RP (Reporting)
Simplify names to match official NIST

**4. RECOVER FUNCTIONAL AREA DISCREPANCY**
------------------------------------------
**Current User Structure (2 categories):**
- RC.RP: Incident Recovery Plan Execution ✓ (name difference)
- RC.CO: Incident Recovery Communication ✓ (name difference)

**Official NIST CSF 2.0 Structure (3 categories):**
- RC.RP: Recovery Planning ✓
- RC.IM: Improvements ❌ MISSING
- RC.CO: Communications ✓

**PROPOSED CORRECTION:**
Add: RC.IM (Improvements)
Simplify names to match official NIST

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (AWAITING APPROVAL):**
============================================

**Phase 1: Update Category Structure**
- Add missing categories: PR.MA, PR.PT, DE.DP, RC.IM
- Remove non-standard: PR.IR
- Rename categories to match official NIST naming

**Phase 2: Add Missing Subcategories**
- Research and add all subcategories for new categories
- Ensure complete control mapping for comprehensive scoring

**Phase 3: Update System Integration**
- Modify gap analysis to handle updated structure
- Update scoring calculations for new category counts
- Preserve GOVERN structure (perfect for RASBITA Governance)

**Phase 4: Questionnaire Mapping**
- Map existing questionnaire responses to new structure
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible

**CONTROL COUNT IMPACT:**
Current: ~108 controls
After correction: ~120+ controls (closer to official NIST)

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR USER APPROVAL:**

1. Should we update to match official NIST CSF 2.0 exactly?
2. Should we preserve existing Expel-based naming for compatibility?
3. Should we implement all missing categories or only specific ones?
4. Should we maintain backward compatibility with current assessments?

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Update structure to match official NIST CSF 2.0 for authenticity and compliance, while preserving GOVERN structure for RASBITA Governance implementation.

**AWAITING USER DECISION BEFORE PROCEEDING**
