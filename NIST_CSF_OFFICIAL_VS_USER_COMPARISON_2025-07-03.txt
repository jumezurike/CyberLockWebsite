NIST CSF 2.0 OFFICIAL VS USER STRUCTURE COMPARISON - JULY 3, 2025
================================================================

COMPARISON RESULTS BASED ON OFFICIAL NIST CSF 2.0 REFERENCE:

**FUNCTIONAL AREA VERIFICATION:**
✅ ALL 6 FUNCTIONAL AREAS MATCH OFFICIAL NIST:
- GOVERN (GV) ✓
- IDENTIFY (ID) ✓  
- PROTECT (PR) ✓
- DETECT (DE) ✓
- RESPOND (RS) ✓
- RECOVER (RC) ✓

**CATEGORY VERIFICATION:**

**1. GOVERN (GV) - ✅ PERFECT MATCH**
Official NIST Categories:
- GV.OC: Organizational Context ✓
- GV.RM: Risk Management Strategy ✓
- GV.RR: Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities ✓
- GV.PO: Policy ✓
- GV.OV: Oversight ✓
- GV.SC: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management ✓
Controls: 32 total (5+7+4+2+3+10) ✓

**2. IDENTIFY (ID) - ✅ PERFECT MATCH**
Official NIST Categories:
- ID.AM: Asset Management ✓
- ID.RA: Risk Assessment ✓
- ID.IM: Improvement ✓
Controls: 21 total (7+10+4) ✓

**3. PROTECT (PR) - ⚠️ DISCREPANCY FOUND**
Official NIST Categories:
- PR.AA: Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control ✓
- PR.AT: Awareness and Training ✓
- PR.DS: Data Security ✓
- PR.PS: Platform Security ✓ (User has this)
- PR.IR: Technology Infrastructure Resilience ✓ (User has this)

❌ MISSING FROM USER'S STRUCTURE:
- PR.MA: Maintenance (Official NIST category)

User shows: PR.PS (Platform Security) and PR.IR (Tech Infrastructure Resilience)
Official NIST: PR.MA (Maintenance) should also be present

**4. DETECT (DE) - ⚠️ MAJOR DISCREPANCY**
Official NIST Categories:
- DE.AE: Anomalies and Events
- DE.CM: Continuous Monitoring
- DE.DP: Detection Processes

❌ USER'S STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES:
User has: DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring) + DE.AE (Adverse Event Analysis)
Official: DE.AE (Anomalies and Events) + DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring) + DE.DP (Detection Processes)

**MISSING FROM USER:** DE.DP (Detection Processes)

**5. RESPOND (RS) - ⚠️ DISCREPANCY**
Official NIST Categories:
- RS.MA: Management
- RS.AN: Analysis  
- RS.MI: Mitigation
- RS.RP: Reporting

❌ USER'S STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES:
User has: RS.MA (Incident Management) + RS.AN (Incident Analysis) + RS.CO (Incident Response Reporting and Communication) + RS.MI (Incident Mitigation)
Official: RS.MA (Management) + RS.AN (Analysis) + RS.MI (Mitigation) + RS.RP (Reporting)

User uses "RS.CO" instead of official "RS.RP"

**6. RECOVER (RC) - ⚠️ DISCREPANCY**
Official NIST Categories:
- RC.RP: Recovery Planning
- RC.IM: Improvements  
- RC.CO: Communications

❌ USER'S STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES:
User has: RC.RP (Incident Recovery Plan Execution) + RC.CO (Incident Recovery Communication)
Official: RC.RP (Recovery Planning) + RC.IM (Improvements) + RC.CO (Communications)

**MISSING FROM USER:** RC.IM (Improvements)

**SUMMARY:**
✅ GOVERN and IDENTIFY: Perfect match with official NIST
⚠️ PROTECT: Missing PR.MA (Maintenance) 
⚠️ DETECT: Missing DE.DP (Detection Processes)
⚠️ RESPOND: Uses RS.CO instead of RS.RP  
⚠️ RECOVER: Missing RC.IM (Improvements)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
User's structure appears to be based on an Expel or third-party interpretation rather than the official NIST CSF 2.0. For RASBITA Governance implementation, the GOVERN section is perfect and can proceed as planned.
